          <li>A <b>variable</b> is a named container that allows us to store data 
            in our code.</li>

          <li>To declare a variable, we use the var keyword</li>

          <li><b>Control flow</b> is the order in which a computer executes 
            code in a script.</li>

          <li><b>Conditional statements</b> and <b>loops</b> are used to control the order 
            in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>

          <li> An <b>if</b> statement is a way of introducing decision-making 
            into our code.</li>

          <li>The <b>if</b> statement will only execute if the statement meets a 
            condition, or is true</li>

          <li>A value is considered <b>falsy</b> if it is one of the following 
            values: 0, -0, On, " ", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the 
            value of false.</li>

          <li>A <b>truthy</b> is all other values, including a Boolean with the value of 
            true</li>
          
          <li>An <b>array</b> is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>

          <li>An <b>index</b> is the location of the data item in the array, it starts 
            counting at 0 and goes from there. [0, 1, 2, 3]</li>

          <li>A <b>for</b> loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on 
            all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed 
            over and over.</li>

          <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements: 
            <b>Starting point for our loop</b>, 
            <b>Condition</b>, 
            <b>inderate</b>.
          </li>

          <li>Indices follow a predictable pattern, it increasses by 1 each time. 
            x++ === x+1</li>
